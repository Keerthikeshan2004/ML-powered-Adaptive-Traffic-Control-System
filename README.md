STEP 1: # ML-powered-Adaptive-Traffic-Control-System
The ML-Powered Adaptive Traffic Control System uses YOLO object detection to dynamically adjust signal timings based on real-time vehicle density. It detects cars, bikes, buses, and motorcycles, optimizing traffic flow. An alert system notifies traffic police via Twilio SMS when congestion exceeds the threshold, ensuring efficient management. 

 STEP 2: create a Twilio acoount and get AUTH_SID,AUTH_TOKEN and Twilio_phone.no
 STEP 3: Download 4 traffic videos from any platform in the format of ".mp4".
 STEP 4: Run the code.
