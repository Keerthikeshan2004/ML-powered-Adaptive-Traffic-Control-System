# ML-powered-Adaptive-Traffic-Control-System
The ML-Powered Adaptive Traffic Control System uses YOLO object detection to dynamically adjust signal timings based on real-time vehicle density. It detects cars, bikes, buses, and motorcycles, optimizing traffic flow. An alert system notifies traffic police via Twilio SMS when congestion exceeds the threshold, ensuring efficient management.
